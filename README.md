Final Project for PIC10C

Project: Pokemon Jump

My goal is to write a game similar to the google dinosaur game. There will be a pokemon moves left on a straight line and some barricades. Players can control the pokemon to jump to avoid barricades.  I will also add new features such as special tools to help player gain higher points. I'll mainly use C++ and Qt and try to animate those images.
