# Pic10C-FinalProject
Final Project for PIC10C
Using Qt creator to design a game with GUI.

Idea1
Project: Pokemon Jump

My goal is to write a game similar to the google dinosaur game. There will be a pokemon moves left on a straight line and some barricades. Players can control the pokemon to jump to avoid barricades.  I will also add new features such as special tools to help player gain higher points. I'll mainly use C++ and Qt and try to animate those images.

Idea2
Project: Whac-A-Pokemon

Player is able to hit the Pokemon that randomly goes out side pokeballs in a 5*5 grid with a hammer (similar to Wrack-A-Mole). Each hit adds score of one. In order to successfully run the program, download images and put them in the directory specified in the program (or change the directory in the program to correctly load those images)
