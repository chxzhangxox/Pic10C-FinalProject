# Pic10C-FinalProject
Final Project for PIC10C

Idea1
Project: Pokemon Jump

My goal is to write a game similar to the google dinosaur game. There will be a pokemon moves left on a straight line and some barricades. Players can control the pokemon to jump to avoid barricades.  I will also add new features such as special tools to help player gain higher points. I'll mainly use C++ and Qt and try to animate those images.

Idea2
Project: Whac-A-Pokemon

Player is able to hit the Pokemon that randomly moves up and down with a hammer. With different pokemons the scores are different. Also pokemons associates with higher score will move faster.
